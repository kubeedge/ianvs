## Project Background

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven the adoption of cloud-edge collaborative inference architectures, where computationally intensive inference tasks are distributed between edge devices and cloud servers to optimize performance and resource utilization. However, this paradigm introduces critical privacy challenges, particularly when processing user prompts containing sensitive personal information. With the enactment of China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which mandates strict requirements for cross-border data transmission including "minimal necessity" and "security assurance" principles, organizations face an urgent need to develop privacy-preserving solutions that comply with regulatory requirements while maintaining inference quality. Traditional approaches often require transmitting raw text across borders, creating significant privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges. This project addresses the fundamental tension between privacy protection and inference utility in cloud-edge collaborative LLM systems, particularly in scenarios requiring cross-border data processing.

## Problems Solved

This project addresses three critical problems in cloud-edge collaborative LLM inference systems. First, it eliminates the privacy leakage risks associated with raw text cross-border transmission by implementing a zero raw text transmission architecture that converts sensitive prompts into anonymized feature vectors before any cross-border transfer occurs. Second, it ensures PIPL compliance by implementing strict adherence to Articles 38-40 of PIPL, including minimal necessity checks, privacy budget management, and real-time compliance verification mechanisms. Third, it resolves the privacy-utility trade-off challenge by developing adaptive privacy desensitization techniques—including differential privacy, saliency-guided masking, and dimensionality reduction—that preserve inference quality while providing strong privacy guarantees. The framework prevents unauthorized reconstruction of original user data from transmitted anonymized vectors, ensuring that sensitive personal information such as names, identification numbers, and locations cannot be recovered by cloud-side adversaries or through membership inference attacks.

## Project Results

The project has achieved comprehensive results across multiple dimensions. Technically, it delivers a complete PIPL-compliant cloud-edge collaborative privacy-preserving prompt processing framework integrated into KubeEdge-Ianvs, featuring edge-first inference with hard sample mining, adaptive privacy desensitization (regex patterns, NER masking, and differential privacy), and real-time compliance monitoring with audit logging. The framework achieves zero raw text cross-border transmission while maintaining inference accuracy comparable to non-privacy-preserving baselines. Academically, it introduces ChnSentiCorp-Lite, the first PIPL-compliant cross-border LLM inference benchmark dataset with 3,000 samples, multi-layer privacy annotations, synthetic PII templates, and dedicated attack evaluation subsets for comprehensive privacy assessment. The project provides a complete evaluation methodology covering utility metrics (task accuracy, end-to-end latency), privacy metrics (Neighbourhood MIA, LOSS Attack, LiRA), and compliance metrics (minimal necessity validation, budget compliance checks, audit integrity verification). Practically, the framework demonstrates successful deployment with Llama-3-8B-Instruct on edge devices and GPT-4o-mini on cloud servers, showcasing production-ready capabilities for privacy-preserving LLM inference in regulated environments.
