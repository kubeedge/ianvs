# Cloud-Edge Collaborative Inference Benchmark: A Privacy-Utility Evaluation Framework

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven their deployment across distributed cloud-edge architectures, enabling low-latency inference and efficient resource utilization. However, this distributed paradigm introduces critical privacy and performance challenges that remain unaddressed by existing frameworks:

- **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff Imbalance**: Current systems often prioritize either privacy protection (at the cost of inference accuracy) or performance (at the cost of data exposure), lacking adaptive mechanisms to balance both.
- **Inefficient Processing Routing**: Many frameworks default to cloud processing for complex tasks without first attempting edge inference, increasing latency and privacy risks through unnecessary data transmission.
- **Limited Privacy Protection Granularity**: Existing solutions typically apply a one-size-fits-all privacy method rather than selecting protection intensity based on data sensitivity.
- **Incomplete Evaluation Metrics**: There is a lack of comprehensive metrics that simultaneously assess privacy preservation, inference accuracy, and system performance in collaborative environments.
- **Absence of Standardized Benchmarking**: Few frameworks provide integrated tooling for systematic evaluation across diverse privacy scenarios using established datasets.

This project addresses these gaps through a privacy-first cloud-edge collaborative inference framework that implements adaptive processing routing, multi-level privacy protection, and comprehensive benchmarking capabilities validated with the Text Anonymization Benchmark (TAB) dataset.

## Project Purpose

The Cloud-Edge Collaborative Inference Benchmark aims to:

- Enable **privacy-preserving distributed inference** by prioritizing edge processing while intelligently leveraging cloud resources for complex tasks.
- Provide **adaptive privacy protection** through multiple desensitization techniques, selecting appropriate methods based on data sensitivity.
- Establish **comprehensive evaluation metrics** that quantify both privacy preservation and system performance.
- Facilitate **systematic benchmarking** using standardized datasets to compare collaborative inference strategies.
- Offer a **flexible platform** for researchers and developers to experiment with privacy-performance tradeoffs in real-world cloud-edge environments.

## Details of Design

### Core Workflow

![image-20251031085231877](images/flowchart.png)

The framework's inference routing follows a structured sequential process with privacy as the core principle:

1. **Privacy Detection**: All input data first undergoes privacy detection to identify sensitive information (PII, sensitive entities, etc.).
2. **Non-Private Data Handling**: If no sensitive information is detected, the data is routed directly to cloud inference for processing.
3. **Private Data Handling**: If sensitive information is detected:
   - 3.1 **Edge Inference First**: Data is processed locally using the edge model.
   - 3.2 Result Evaluation: The edge model's output is evaluated against a confidence threshold:
     - 3.2.1 **Threshold Met**: If edge inference confidence meets or exceeds the threshold, the edge result is returned.
     - 3.2.2 **Threshold Not Met**: If confidence is insufficient, an appropriate privacy protection method is applied, and the sanitized data is sent to the cloud for further processing.

### Key Components

#### 3.2.1 Privacy Detection Module

This module identifies sensitive information using a combination of:

- Pattern matching for structured PII (emails, phone numbers, IDs)
- NLP-based entity recognition (using spaCy models) for contextual sensitive entities
- Sensitivity scoring based on predefined and customizable entity categories

#### 3.2.2 Hard Sample Mining (Routing Logic)

The OracleRouter module determines processing destinations based on:

- Edge model confidence scores
- Data sensitivity levels
- Privacy requirements

#### 3.2.3 Privacy Protection Methods

Multi-level privacy desensitization techniques with varying complexity:

- **Regex Pseudonymization (Complexity 1)**: Rule-based masking of structured PII
- **NER Masking (Complexity 2)**: Context-aware masking using named entity recognition
- **Differential Privacy (Complexity 3)**: Adding mathematically controlled noise to sensitive data

#### 3.2.4 Evaluation Metrics

Comprehensive metrics for assessing both privacy and performance:

**Privacy Metrics**:

- **PII Detection Rate (PDR)**: Percentage of PII successfully identified and protected
- **Sensitive Entity Leakage Score (SELS)**: Quantification of sensitive information remaining after protection
- **Inference Attack Resistance (IAR)**: Resistance to privacy inference attacks using auxiliary information
- **Contextual Privacy Preservation (CPP)**: Preservation of contextual meaning while protecting privacy

**Performance Metrics**:

- **Latency Overhead (LO)**: Additional latency introduced by privacy protection
- **Accuracy Preservation Rate (APR)**: Inference accuracy retained after privacy processing
- **Throughput Impact (TI)**: Reduction in system throughput due to privacy measures

## Discussion

#### PII Detection Rate
This metric measures the accuracy of detecting personally identifiable information. Regex Pseudonymization's variable rate shows its struggle with non-standard PII despite handling common formats well. NER Masking generally detects context-sensitive PII well but depends on model quality. Differential Privacy, focused on noise, doesn't directly detect but affects the perceived PII. This variance reflects different detection approaches and limitations.

#### Sensitive Entity Leakage Score
Regex Pseudonymization has leakage due to its rigid rules for complex entities. NER Masking likely has less leakage for context-sensitive items, but can err. Differential Privacy's noise makes leakage hard to quantify. Scores show different protection effectiveness. It quantifies the amount of sensitive information that remains unprotected after the privacy protection process. 

#### Inference Attack Resistance
This metric evaluates the ability of the anonymized data to resist inference attacks. Differential Privacy offers strong resistance with noise addition. Regex Pseudonymization provides moderate protection by masking but may have exploitable patterns. NER Masking also helps, but isn't as robust. 

#### Contextual Privacy Preservation
Regex Pseudonymization disrupts context with its rigid masking. NER Masking, context-aware, performs better but can be affected by errors. Differential Privacy's noise impacts context, too. It measures how well the contextual meaning of the data is preserved during the privacy protection process. 

#### Latency Overhead
Regex Pseudonymization has variable latency based on pattern complexity. NER Masking is slower due to semantic analysis. Differential Privacy incurs latency from noise computation. 

#### **Accuracy Preservation Rate **

It calculates the similarity between the inference result and the standard answer, reflecting the impact of the privacy protection process on the accuracy of the model. Regex Pseudonymization can have a significant impact on accuracy, with variable rates depending on how masking affects the data for model processing. NER Masking may preserve accuracy well if the NER model is accurate, but can reduce it if there are errors. 

### Overall Performance Summary
Regex Pseudonymization is simple for structured PII but falters with complexity, offers moderate privacy and variable latency. NER Masking is good for context-sensitive PII but relies on model quality and has high latency. Differential Privacy excels at inference resistance but affects data accuracy and incurs computational cost. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses for different privacy needs. 

## Future Work

- Expand privacy desensitization methods to include advanced techniques such as federated learning-based privacy preservation
- Introduce more granular privacy detection metrics covering emerging sensitive data categories
- Enhance cross-framework compatibility for seamless integration with diverse cloud and edge platforms
- Develop automated tuning mechanisms for optimal privacy-performance tradeoff configurations
- Extend support for multi-modal data (images, audio) in collaborative inference scenarios
