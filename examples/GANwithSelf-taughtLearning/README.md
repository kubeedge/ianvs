# Integrating GAN and Self-taught Learning into Ianvs Lifelong Learning

## Overview

We proposal an approach of combining [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) and [Self-taught Learning](https://ai.stanford.edu/~hllee/icml07-selftaughtlearning.pdf) to solve small sample problem in the very stage of ianvs lifelong learning, as shown in the figure below.

For quick start, jumping directly to [Developer Notes](##Developer Notes) is fine.

We describe the arichtecture and the process. More details can be seen in the [Architecture](##Architecture).

1. Train GAN with orginal small sample data
2. GAN generates more data according to the probability distribution
3. Train Autoencoder (which is consist of encoder and decoder) with the data generated by GAN
4. Use encoder to get feature representation of original small sample data
5. Use feature representation and orignal labels to train model that the user needs
6. Ouput a well trained model

## Developer Notes

```bash
GANwithSelf-taughtLearning # root path of the project
	- config.yaml # the config of input path (dataset and model to be trained) as well as hyperparameter of GAN and Self-taught Learning
	- GAN # GAN module
		- models.py # define discriminator and generator
		- train.py # train GAN here
		- ./train_results # training outputs, like GAN model, training loss and evaluation of GAN
	- self-taught-learning # self-taught learning module
		- models.py # Define AutoEncoder. Here we use Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE).
		- train.py # train GAN here
		- ./train_results # training outputs, like encoder model and training loss
	- model-to-be-trained # model to be trained module
		- train.py # train model
		- model.py # define model
		- ./train_results # training results of the model to be trained
	- util.py # util module
```

To use, config the `config.yaml` to let `GANwithSelf-taughtLearning` know where the **dataset** is, what **model** you want to train and the **hyperparameters**.

A common use process can be shown below:

1. run `./GAN/train.py`
2. run `./self-taught-learning/train.py`
3. run `./train.py`
