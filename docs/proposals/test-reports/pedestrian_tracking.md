# Implement function of automatically algorithm performance tests for Sedna Edge-cloud Re-ID

## Motivation

Person Re-ID based on Cloud-edge collaborative architecture is a new example feature that Ianvs will soon support, which can continuously recognize, track and search the target person provided by the user in the source video, and push the video containing the search results to the streaming media server. Since each service module flexibly supports the AI model, it is necessary to provide users with the actual performance test of THE AI algorithm to provide a reference for the actual search effect of the system.

## Goals

1. This feature supports the existing capabilities and runtime of Ianvs and integrate into the Re-ID features;
2. This framework use open-source datasets to create test reports automatically, need to define metrics, related interface, preprocessing, and etc;
3. This framework have detailed guidance documents.

## Proposal

This project includes two tasks: pedestrian tracking and pedestrian re-identification. The performance metrics and datasets of these tasks are determined as follows.

## Design Details

### Metrics and Datasets

#### Pedestrian tracking

[MOT17](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17) is a benchmark datasets in the area of pedestrian tracking.

The following performance metrics are selected for pedestrian tracking.

1. **Accuracy**
2. **Precision**
3. **Recall**
4. **F1 score**

5. **MOTA**

   $MOTA=1-\frac{FN+FP+ID Sw}{G T} \in(-\infty, 1]$

6. **MOTP**

7. **IDF1**

   $IDF_{1}=\frac{2IDTP}{2IDTP+IDFP+IDFN}$

   $IDP=\frac{IDTP}{IDTP+IDFP}$

   $IDR=\frac{IDTP}{IDTP+IDFN}$

#### Pedestrian Re-identification

[Market-1501](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Zheng_Scalable_Person_Re-Identification_ICCV_2015_paper.html) is a benchmark datasets in the area of pedestrian tracking.

The following performance metrics are selected for re-identification.

1. **Accuracy**

2. **Precision**

3. **Recall**

4. **F1 score**

5. **Rank-1**: first hit rate

   $\operatorname{rank} 1=\frac{1}{\|Q\|} \sum_{q \in Q} \mathbb{1}\left(l_{q}, l_{1}^{q}\right)$

6. **Rank-5**: top 5 hit rate

7. **Rank-10**: top 10 hit rate

8. **Rank-20**: top 20 hit rate

### Framework
![framework](images/pedestrian_tracking_framework.png)

### Embedded in Ianvs

This proposal is planned to be added to Ianvs in the form of a example. We provide datasets for tracking and Re-ID. Then users upload tracking and Re-ID algorithms. Finally, the test report is generated.

Files added are as follows:
