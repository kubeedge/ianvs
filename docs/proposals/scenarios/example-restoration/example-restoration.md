# KubeEdge Ianvs Example Restoration 

Focused Example Restoration and CI/CD Pipeline Development for Distributed Synergy AI Benchmarking

---

## Background

Edge computing emerges as a promising technical framework to overcome the challenges in cloud computing. In this machine-learning era, the AI application becomes one of the most critical types of applications on the edge. Driven by the increasing computation power of edge devices and the increasing amount of data generated from the edge, distributed synergy AI benchmarking has become essential for evaluating edge AI performance across device, edge, and cloud intelligence layers.

Ianvs serves as KubeEdge SIG AI distributed benchmark toolkit. As more and more contributors running, KubeEdge Ianvs now has **25+ examples** and the number is still increasing. KubeEdge Ianvs then faces mounting usability issues due to dependency evolution and validation mechanisms. As Python versions, third-party libraries, and Ianvs features advance, partial historical examples fail to execute. This has led to surging user-reported Issues from confused contributors, untested PRs breaking core functionality of legacy features, severely outdated documentation misaligning with actual capabilities.

Without systematic intervention, the examples risk becoming obsolete for edge-AI developers and especially newcomers. According to recent developer surveys, contributors suffer from the lack of support on reliable examples and consistent execution environments; while new users are lost in the sea of broken dependencies and outdated configurations. That limits the wide application of distributed synergy AI techniques and hinders a prosperous ecosystem development. A comprehensive example restoration and validation framework is thus needed to ensure reliable benchmarking capabilities and optimize the contributor experience.

This proposal provides a systematic restoration approach for one complete distributed synergy AI example, so that contributors and maintainers can benefit from efficient maintenance support and consistent benchmark execution.

## Goals

For contributors and maintainers of distributed synergy AI solutions, the goals of the example restoration project are:

### **Primary Goals (Core Deliverables):**
- **Complete end-to-end restoration of one lifelong learning example** 
    - Full dependency resolution and compatibility fixing across Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
    - Comprehensive documentation with step-by-step execution guide and troubleshooting playbook
    - Validated execution with 100% success rate and performance baseline establishment

- **Establish CI/CD pipeline infrastructure for automated validation**
    - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing of the restored example
    - Multi-Python version compatibility testing and dependency validation
    - Failure detection, reporting, and clear feedback mechanisms for contributors

### **Optional Goals (Time Permitting - Maintenance Layer):**
- **Advanced maintenance automation tools** for contributors by providing
    - Automated dependency checking and conflict resolution tools
    - Example health monitoring dashboard and alert systems  
    - Documentation synchronization and auto-generation capabilities

- **Systematic maintenance framework** for maintainers by establishing
    - Template framework for extending restoration to additional examples
    - Automated maintenance task scheduling and execution tracking
    - Community contribution guidelines and validation standards

## Proposal

The distributed synergy AI example restoration project aims to resurrect the usability of one complete example and establish a CI/CD pipeline framework, with optional advanced maintenance tools if time permits.

### **Core Scope (Primary Focus):**

    - Advanced dependency management and health monitoring systems
    - Automated documentation generation and synchronization tools
    - Example health dashboards and alerting mechanisms

**Targeting users:**
