# KubeEdge Ianvs Example Restoration 

Comprehensive Example Restoration and Usability Enhancement for Distributed Synergy AI Benchmarking

---

## Background

Edge computing emerges as a promising technical framework to overcome the challenges in cloud computing. In this machine-learning era, the AI application becomes one of the most critical types of applications on the edge. Driven by the increasing computation power of edge devices and the increasing amount of data generated from the edge, distributed synergy AI benchmarking has become essential for evaluating edge AI performance across device, edge, and cloud intelligence layers.

Ianvs serves as KubeEdge SIG AI distributed benchmark toolkit. As more and more contributors running, KubeEdge Ianvs now has **25+ examples** and the number is still increasing. KubeEdge Ianvs then faces mounting usability issues due to dependency evolution and validation mechanisms. As Python versions, third-party libraries, and Ianvs features advance, partial historical examples fail to execute. This has led to surging user-reported Issues from confused contributors, untested PRs breaking core functionality of legacy features, severely outdated documentation misaligning with actual capabilities.

Without systematic intervention, the example risks becoming obsolete for edge-AI developers and especially newcomers. According to recent developer surveys, contributors suffer from the lack of support on reliable examples and consistent execution environments; while new users are lost in the sea of broken dependencies and outdated configurations. That limits the wide application of distributed synergy AI techniques and hinders a prosperous ecosystem development. A comprehensive example restoration and validation framework is thus needed to ensure reliable benchmarking capabilities and optimize the developer experience.

This proposal provides a systematic restoration approach for distributed synergy AI examples, so that AI developers and end users can benefit from efficient development support and consistent benchmark execution.

## Goals

For developers or end users of distributed synergy AI solutions, the goals of the example restoration framework are:
- **Facilitating efficient development** for developers by ensuring
    - Reliable test cases including dataset validation and corresponding tools
    - Consistent benchmarking tools including dependency management and runtime validation
    - Multi-version Python support (3.8, 3.9, 3.10) with automated compatibility testing
- **Revealing best practices** for developers and end users
    - Enhanced documentation including step-by-step tutorials and debugging playbooks
    - Automated quality assurance including CI/CD pipelines and performance monitoring
    - Community support tools including issue templates and troubleshooting guides

## Proposal

The distributed synergy AI example restoration project aims to resurrect the usability of existing examples and establish sustainable maintenance practices, in order to facilitate more efficient and effective development workflows.

The scope of restoration includes:
- **Providing end-to-end example reliability** across 25+ examples covering typical distributed-synergy AI paradigms and applications
    - Tools to validate test environments including dependency compatibility checking and license compliance scanning
    - Tools to monitor example health including runtime validation, performance profiling, and automated failure detection
    - Tools to maintain documentation currency including auto-generation of tutorials and synchronization with code changes
- **Cooperation with KubeEdge community** to establish comprehensive example maintenance practices, which can include but are not limited to
    - Dependency standardization, version locking, and conflict resolution
    - Automated testing pipelines with multi-version Python support
    - Documentation modernization with reproducible step-by-step guides
    - Performance benchmarking and regression prevention mechanisms
    - Community contribution guidelines and example validation standards

**Targeting users:**
- **Developers**: Build and test edge-cloud collaborative AI solutions reliably from working examples
- **Contributors**: Submit examples and modifications with confidence through automated validation
- **End users**: Execute distributed synergy AI benchmarks consistently across different environments

**The scope of restoration does NOT include:**
- Re-invent existing Ianvs core architecture (Test Environment Manager, Test Case Controller, Story Manager)
- Re-invent existing KubeEdge platform or edge-cloud synergy frameworks
- Re-invent existing AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MindSpore)
- Re-invent existing monitoring or visualization tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
