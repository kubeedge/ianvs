# Embodied Intelligence Industrial Assembly:Implementation on KubeEdge-lanvs 

---

## Introduction

With the evolution of intelligent industrial manufacturing, industrial robots, flexible production lines, and intelligent testing equipment are continuously being innovated. With its efficient data processing and real-time response capabilities, the need for intelligent, adaptable, and perception-rich robotic systems is also growing rapidly.

It is noteworthy that the current industrial demand for embodied intelligent services has developed in depth in the direction of high-precision perception decision-making, dynamic real-time response, and integrated multi-stage control.

This project aims to build an **Embodied Intelligence (EI) Benchmarking Suite** based on the **KubeEdge-Ianvs framework**, providing realistic datasets, simulation environments, and benchmarking pipelines that reflect real-world constraints in industries.Our goal is to build professional and industry-level specific intelligent capabilities suitable for the high-precision field of industrial assembly.

However, existing universal embodied intelligence benchmarks struggle to provide accurate assessments because they lack targeted consideration of complex, end-to-end assembly workflows that combine perception, force-control, and intelligent quality assurance. This has become a key bottleneck restricting the development of industrial embodied intelligence technology.

## Proposal

### Scope

#### For Developers

1.**Create the Dataset**: Build a new, multimodal dataset that includes both visual and touch sensor data.

2.**Develop Simple Algorithm Modules**: Create two simple, sequential modules: an object detection module (to find the component) and an assembly module (to place it). These algorithms will demonstrate that the new dataset is usable.

3.**Define End-to-End Metrics**: Instead of focusing on metrics for each individual sub-task (like YOLO accuracy), define one or a few end-to-end metrics to evaluate the complete assembly process, such as the overall success rate or final assembly accuracy. This aligns with the "multi-stage" nature of the project.

#### End Users

1.**Access the Dataset**: Provide a publicly available, high-quality dataset that can be easily downloaded and used.

2.**Access Baseline Algorithms**: Offer a well-documented and functional baseline algorithm that serves as a learning example.

3.**Use Defined Metrics**: Deliver a set of clear, pre-defined metrics that allow users to evaluate their own work against a standard.


### Out of Scope

1.**Re-inventing Core Frameworks**: The project will use existing, open-source frameworks like PyBullet, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, rather than creating new ones.

2.**Developing Fundamental AI Models**: The project will apply established, off-the-shelf models like YOLOv8 and standard CNNs as a baseline. The focus is on the creation of a `new assembly algorithm`, not on inventing a new fundamental AI model.

3.**New Robotic Hardware**: Since the benchmark operates in a simulation, it does not include the design, fabrication, or physical testing of new robot hardware or sensors.

4.**Developing a New Benchmarking Platform**: The project is a benchmark suite that runs within the existing Ianvs framework and will not involve building a new platform.

5.**Complex Logical Reasoning**: Advanced logic, such as for complex failure recovery or cable sorting, is considered future work and is not included in the initial implementation.

![Ianvs Framework Architecture](images\benchmarking_architecture.png)
*Figure above: Ianvs framework architecture showing the integration of Test Environment Manager, Test Case Controller, and Story Manager for benchmarking embodied intelligence in industrial environments.*

The initial focus is on configuring the custom, multi-modal `Intelligent Assembly Dataset` within the Test Environment Manager and establishing the multi-stage performance metrics. Simultaneously, the `Test Case Controller` will be implemented with a new multi-stage Assembly Workflow. This paradigm will perform comprehensive benchmark tests on the custom dataset, evaluating the full, end-to-end workflow—from component positioning with `YOLOv8`.


### Test Environment Manager Integration

This project will be configured and deployed by defining a new `Test Environment` that specifies all the necessary components for the benchmarking process.

3.**Algorithm Parameters**: The configuration will include hyperparameters for our core algorithms, like YOLO and force control logic.
4.**System Constraints**: Define hardware and software constraints, such as processing time and memory limits, to ensure reproducibility.
5.**Metrics Calculation**: Compute our primary end-to-end metric: Assembly Success Rate.

### Test Case Controller Implementation

The `Test Case Controller` will be responsible for orchestrating the execution of our end-to-end assembly workflow.

1.**Algorithm Template**: Implement a template that defines the sequential, multi-stage process: perception → manipulation → verification.
2.**Data Loading**: Automated downloading and loading of our custom dataset from Kaggle.
3.**Execution Pipeline**: The controller will execute the full workflow step-by-step, running object detection, assembly, and visual inspection.

### Story Manager Output

The `Story Manager` will handle the output and presentation of our benchmark results, providing clear insights into the algorithm's performance.

1.**Leaderboard Generation**: The results will be used to generate a leaderboard that ranks algorithm performance.
2.**Report Generation**: A detailed report with a full analysis of the benchmark results will be produced.

### **Multi-stage Assembly Workflow**

This proposal focuses on a multi-stage, single-task assembly process, which is a more accurate representation of real-world industrial workflows. The approach integrates multiple, sequential AI capabilities into a single cohesive pipeline. It demonstrates an embodied intelligent system that can perceive, manipulate, verify, and reason in a step-by-step manner.

The Single-Task, multi-stage Paradigm works as follows:

1.A developer deploys an application that orchestrates the entire assembly process.
2.The application launches the full workflow, which executes a series of interdependent, sequential tasks.
3.The robotic arm uses **YOLOv8** to perform real-time object detection on components from the panel and Cnn for final inspection.[CNN inspection](images\CNN_of_motherboard.png)
4.The robot then executes a force-controlled assembly task using its touch sensors to place the components on the motherboard precisely.[touch sensors](images\force_sensors.png)
5.The system then generates a final test report and updates the leaderboard, concluding the process.

## Dataset Management

Different datasets will be used to train the robotic AI model:

1.**The New Dataset** : It is the custom-made data from PyBullet simulation, including the URDFs, images of the assembled phone, and sensor logs.

2.**REASSEMBLE** :  Used as a "practice test" to train and validate the fundamental skills of your robotic arm, especially for force-controlled insertion.

3.**DeepPCB** : It's a collection of images of electronic circuit boards with defects. This data is used to train quality control AI to recognize defects on a motherboard.

### Dataset Description

The Multimodal Robot Assembly Dataset is a comprehensive, open-source dataset designed for benchmarking end-to-end industrial assembly tasks. It focuses on the complex, multi-stage process of assembling electronic components with a robotic arm, leveraging both visual and haptic feedback.

The dataset captures the entire assembly workflow, from initial component detection to precise, force-controlled placement and final visual inspection. It provides a rich collection of synchronized multimodal data, including:

1.**RGB and Depth Images**: High-resolution visual input from a simulated camera in '.png' format will be obtained for preserving the quality of both color and depth information without artifacts.

2.**Force/Torque Sensor Data**: Readings from the robot's wrist, providing haptic feedback on contact events during manipulation.This data should be logged in `.csv` or `.json` format for easy to read abd parse for data analysis and training.

3.**Metadata**: Labeled information on object poses, robot joint states, and the success or failure of each step.

4.**YOLO/COCO-style annotations**:The bounding box coordinates and class labels for each image, which are essential for training the object detection model will be obtained ,most common in `json` format.

It will include a training set of 5,000 to 15,000 augmented images derived from an initial set of 100-300 simulated episodes. The total dataset is estimated to be approximately 15-20 GB.
This data enables the development and evaluation of algorithms that integrate vision-based perception with force-controlled manipulation. The dataset is a part of the open-source distributed synergy AI benchmarking project, KubeEdge-Ianvs.

## Future Work and Stretch Goals

To maintain a clear and focused scope for this initial project, certain advanced features will be considered as future work. These enhancements, once implemented, will further validate the complexity and richness of our custom dataset.

1.**Intelligent Decision-Making (Cable Sorting Logic)**: After a successful assembly and quality check, the robot could implement a secondary logical task. This would involve a conditional if-else check to determine which accessory (e.g., USB-C or USB-B cable) to include with the final product. This would demonstrate the robot's ability to reason and adapt its actions based on specific components used during assembly.

2.**Complex Logical Control Flows**: Likely explore implementing more complex logical control flows beyond simple `if-else conditions. This includes advanced state machines and adaptive reasoning that would allow the robot to handle unexpected events, such as re-attempting a component placement if the initial visual inspection fails. These additions would push the boundaries of current embodied intelligence benchmarks.
