          image, target = sample['image'], sample['label']
          if torch.cuda.is_available():
              image, target = image.cuda(), target.cuda()
          target = target.cpu().numpy()

          # Obtain predictions
          predictions = model(image).argmax(dim=1).cpu().numpy()

          # Evaluate batch
          evaluator.add_batch(target, predictions)

      # Compute metrics
