# Background

With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the traditional "direct-to-cloud" inference model requires users to upload prompts containing potentially sensitive information to remote servers. This poses significant privacy and compliance risks, especially in scenarios involving the cross-border transfer of personal information. Meanwhile, lightweight models deployed purely on the edge often fail to meet complex inference performance requirements.

In today's AI application practice, large language models show great potential in natural language processing and intelligent reasoning. However, existing models typically lack specialized optimization for privacy protection and cross-border compliance. Therefore, establishing a privacy-preserving LLM inference framework that complies with PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law) requirements is crucial to improving the compliance and security of these models in real application environments.

# Goals

1. Build the first PIPL-compliant cloud-edge collaborative privacy-preserving LLM inference framework
2. Design a privacy protection evaluation benchmark with zero raw text cross-border transmission
3. Integrate the privacy-preserving LLM framework into the KubeEdge-Ianvs platform

# Proposal

## Building Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference Framework

This proposal implements a "Cloud-Edge Collaborative, PIPL-Compliant" privacy-preserving LLM inference framework on the KubeEdge-Ianvs platform. The core concept is:

1. **Edge-side Privacy Protection**:
   - Perform irreversible privacy transformation on user's sensitive input prompts
   - Convert raw text into anonymized feature vectors
   - Complete PII detection, entity recognition, and privacy classification locally

2. **Cloud-side Inference Processing**:
   - Perform inference based solely on anonymized vectors, never accessing raw text
   - Receive minimal necessary tags to execute core inference tasks
   - Ensure "Zero Raw Text Cross-Border" and "Minimal Tags Cross-Border"

3. **PIPL Compliance Assurance**:
   - Strictly adhere to "minimal necessity" and "security assurance" principles
   - Real-time privacy budget management and audit logging
   - Compliance verification before cross-border transmission

# Design Details

## Scenario Example (Cross-Border E-commerce Customer Service, Multi-turn)

This is a simulated multi-turn conversation in a cross-border e-commerce scenario, demonstrating how the framework dynamically adjusts its privacy strategy based on the conversation content.

* **Jurisdiction & Computing Power**: The edge side is located within mainland China, while the cloud side is located overseas (API service).
* **Privacy Policy Parameters**: High-sensitivity ε≤0.8, general ε≤1.2, default δ=1e-5; session-level budget accumulation and rate limiting.
* **Zero Raw Text Cross-Border**: Only the "anonymized vector + minimal necessary tags" are transmitted throughout the entire process, ensuring the original text never leaves the local jurisdiction.

**Turn 1**

* **User**: The iPhone 15 Pro I bought from your store last week is overheating badly. How can I return it?
* **Edge Side**:
  * The PIPL classifier identifies this prompt as **General Sensitivity** (product issue, no PII).
  * Applies policy: ε=1.0, saliency mask ratio 0.4, projection dimension 768→64.
  * **Cross-Border Payload**: Anonymized Vector (64-dim) + {"intent": "return_request"}.
* **Cloud Side**: Based on the anonymized vector and intent tag, it generates a response with the general return policy and procedure.

**Turn 2**

* **User**: The order number is 2024-09-01-3309, recipient is John Doe, phone is 138****2567. Do I need to pay for the return shipping?
* **Edge Side**:
  * The PIPL classifier identifies **High-Sensitivity Entities** (order number/name/phone).
  * Triggers high-sensitivity policy: ε=0.8; performs local order number validation and entity sanitization.
  * **Cross-Border Payload**: Anonymized Vector (64-dim) + {"order_valid": true, "return_period": "in_range"}.
* **Cloud Side**: Based on the anonymized context and boolean tags, it generates an explanation of the shipping fee policy without including any PII.

**Auditing**: The PIPL classification, sanitization/transformation parameters (ε, mask_ratio, proj_dims), budget accumulation, and cross-border transmission hash are logged for each turn, fulfilling the requirements of minimal necessity and traceability for compliance.

## **Project Structure**

The framework follows the IANVS standard structure for privacy-preserving LLM collaboration:

```

![End-to-End Workflow](<./images/End-to-End Workflow.png>)

## **Core Algorithm Design**

The privacy-preserving LLM inference algorithm is implemented in `privacy_preserving_llm.py` with two integrated modules:

### **Integrated Algorithm Structure (`privacy_preserving_llm.py`)**

```python
class PrivacyPreservingLLM:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # Initialize two core modules
        self.privacy_detector = self._init_detection_module(**kwargs)
        self.privacy_encryptor = self._init_encryption_module(**kwargs)
        
    def train(self, train_data, valid_data=None, **kwargs):
        # IANVS-required train interface
        return self._setup_collaborative_inference()
        
    def predict(self, data, **kwargs):
        # IANVS-required predict interface
        return self._privacy_preserving_inference(data)
        
    def evaluate(self, data, **kwargs):
        # IANVS-required evaluate interface
        return self._compliance_evaluation(data)
```

### **Module 1: Privacy Detection (Integrated)**

**Purpose**: Identifies and classifies privacy-sensitive information in user prompts according to PIPL regulations.

**Key Functions**:
* **Multi-Channel PII Detection**: Regex/rule-based detection, NER, semantic classification
* **PIPL Risk Assessment**: Risk scoring and policy parameter generation
* **Entity Sanitization**: Local validation and minimal tag generation

### **Module 2: Privacy Encryption (Integrated)**

**Purpose**: Performs irreversible transformation of sensitive prompts into anonymized vectors.

**Key Functions**:
* **Differential Privacy Protection**: L2-norm clipping, Gaussian noise injection, budget tracking
* **Saliency-Guided Masking**: Attention-based token importance with configurable suppression
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Johnson-Lindenstrauss projection with semantic preservation
* **Compliance Verification**: Real-time monitoring and audit logging

### **IANVS Integration Workflow**:
1. Receive data through IANVS `predict()` interface
2. Invoke integrated privacy detection for PIPL analysis
3. Apply encryption policies through privacy encryption module
4. Return IANVS-compliant results for framework processing
5. Maintain audit logs accessible to IANVS evaluation system

## **Evaluation Methods & Report**

A one-click script, run_eval_all.sh, is provided to execute three categories of evaluations and generate a report.

### **1. Utility Evaluation**

* **Purpose:** To measure the system's performance on downstream tasks and the associated overhead after introducing the privacy-preserving transformations.  
* **Metrics:**  
  * **Task Accuracy:** For the text sentiment classification task on the ChnSentiCorp-Lite dataset, compare the accuracy change of the cloud-side LLM inference before and after enabling privacy transformations.  
  * **End-to-End Latency:** Measure the total time from user prompt input to receiving the final response to assess the additional performance overhead introduced by the edge-side privacy processing.

### **2. Privacy Evaluation**

* **Purpose:** To quantitatively assess the risk of information leakage through comprehensive attack simulation.  
* **Multi-Attack Evaluation Framework:** Implements **three distinct membership inference attacks** to ensure robust privacy assessment:

**Three Attack Methods:**
  * **Neighbourhood MIA:** Model-agnostic approach using semantically similar neighbor samples
  * **LOSS Attack:** Traditional loss-based membership inference baseline
  * **LiRA:** Advanced likelihood ratio test with theoretical optimality properties

**Metrics:**
  * **Primary:** TPR @ FPR ∈ {1%, 0.1%, 0.01%} and AUC for all three attack methods
  * **Privacy Leakage:** NMI between anonymized vectors and PII categories, DP budget tracking
  * **Defense Effectiveness:** Embedding inversion resistance and privacy-utility trade-offs

### **3. Compliance Evaluation**

* **Purpose:** To verify that the system meets PIPL engineering requirements.  
* **Metrics:** Minimal Necessity Check (payload structure validation), Budget Compliance Check (ε accumulation validation), Audit Integrity Check (log coverage).
