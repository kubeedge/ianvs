# How to test algorithms with Ianvs

With Ianvs installed and related environment prepared, an algorithm developer is then able to test his/her own targeted algorithm. 

## Step 1. Test Case Preparation 
  
Prepare the dataset according to the targeted scenario 
  
Justification: Datasets can be large. To avoid over-size projects in Github ianvs repository, the ianvs executable file and code base do not include origin datasets and developers can download datasets from source links (e.g., from Kaggle) given by ianvs. 

Leverage the ianvs algorithm interface for the targeted algorithm. 
Note that the tested algorithm should follow the ianvs interface to ensure functional benchmarking.
  
## Step 2. Algorithm Development

One may Develop the targeted algorithm as usual. 

## Step 3. ianvs Configuration

Fill configuration files for ianvs

## Step 4. ianvs Execution

Run the executable file of ianvs for benchmarking
   
## Step 5. ianvs Presentation

View the benchmarking result of the targeted algorithms
