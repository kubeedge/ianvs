# Ianvs v0.1.0 release
## 1. Release the Ianvs distributed synergy AI benchmarking framework.
   a) Release test environment management and configuration.
   b) Release test case management and configuration.
   c) Release test story management and configuration.
   d) Release the open-source test case generation tool: Use hyperparameter enumeration to fill in one configuration file to generate multiple test cases.

## 2. Release the PCB-AoI public dataset.
Release the PCB-AoI public dataset, its corresponding preprocessing, and baseline algorithm projects. 
Ianvs is the first open-source site for that dataset.

## 3. Support two new paradigms in test environments and test cases. 
   a) Test environments and test cases that support the single-task learning paradigm.
   b) Test environments and test cases that support the incremental learning paradigm.

## 4. Release PCB-AoI benchmark cases based on the two new paradigms.
   a) Release PCB-AoI benchmark cases based on single-task learning, including leaderboards and test reports.
   b) Release PCB-AoI benchmark cases based on incremental learning, including leaderboards and test reports.
