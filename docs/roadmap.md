# Ianvs v0.3.0 release

## What's New in v0.3.0

Ianvs v0.3.0 brings powerful new LLM-related features, including comprehensive (1) LLM testing and benchmarking tools, (2) advanced cloud-edge collaborative inference paradigms, and (3) innovative algorithms tailored for large model optimization.

### 1. Support for LLM Testing and Benchmarks
Ianvs now supports robust testing for both locally deployed LLMs and public LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI). This release introduces three specialized benchmarks for evaluating LLM capabilities in diverse scenarios:

- Government-Specific Large Model Benchmark: Designed to assess LLM accuracy and reasoning in [government-specific scenarios](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/scenarios/llm-benchmarks/llm-benchmarks.md). using objective (multiple-choice) and subjective (Q&A) tests. [Explore the benchmark dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kubeedgeianvs/the-government-affairs-dataset-govaff/data?select=government_benchmark), [try the example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/government/singletask_learning_bench).

- Smart Coding Benchmark: This benchmark evaluates the debugging capabilities of LLMs using real-world coding issues from GitHub repositories. [Learn more through the example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/smart_coding/smart_coding_learning_bench) and [read the background documentation](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/scenarios/Smart_Coding/Smart%20Coding%20benchmark%20suite%20Proposal.md).

- Large Language Model Edge Benchmark: Focused on testing LLM performance in edge environments, this benchmark evaluates resource efficiency and deployment performance. [Access datasets and examples here](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/llm_simple_qa) and check out the [detailed documentation](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/scenarios/llm-benchmark-suite/llm-edge-benchmark-suite.md).

### 2. Enhanced Cloud-Edge Collaborative Inference
This release introduces new paradigms and algorithms for collaborative inference to optimize cloud-edge cooperation and improve performance:

- Cloud-Edge Collaborative Inference Paradigm: A new architecture enables [efficient cloud-edge collaboration for LLM inference](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/algorithms/joint-inference/cloud-edge-collaboration-inference-for-llm.md), featuring a baseline algorithm that delivers up to 50% token cost savings without compromising accuracy. [Try the example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/cloud-edge-collaborative-inference-for-llm).

- Speculative Decoding Algorithm (EAGLE, ICML'24): Integrated within the collaborative inference framework, this algorithm accelerates inference speeds by 20% or more. [Try the example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/cloud-edge-collaborative-inference-for-llm) and explore [detailed documentation](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/algorithms/joint-inference/cloud-edge-speculative-decoding-for-llm.md).

- Joint Inference Paradigm for Pedestrian Tracking: A multi-edge inference paradigm for pedestrian tracking utilizing the pretrained ByteTrack model (ECCV'22). [See the pedestrian tracking example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/MOT17/multiedge_inference_bench/pedestrian_tracking) or refer to the [background documentation](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/algorithms/multi-edge-inference/Heterogeneous%20Multi-Edge%20Collaborative%20Neural%20Network%20Inference%20for%20High%20Mobility%20Scenarios.md).

### 3. Support for New Large Model Algorithms
Ianvs includes new algorithms to improve LLM performance and usability in various scenarios:

- Personalized LLM Agent Algorithm: This algorithm supports single-task learning using the pretrained Bloom model, enabling personalized LLM operations. [Explore the example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/llm-agent/singletask_learning_bench) and review the [documentation](https://github.com/Frank-lilinjie/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/algorithms/single-task-learning/Personalized%20LLM%20Agent%20based%20on%20KubeEdge-Ianvs%20Cloud-Edge%20Collaboration.md).

- Multimodal Large Model Joint Learning Algorithm: A joint learning algorithm for multimodal understanding with the pretrained RFNet model. [Try the example here](https://github.com/aryan0931/ianvs/tree/main/examples/Cloud_Robotics/singletask_learning_bench/Semantic_Segmentation) and learn more in the [documentation](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/scenarios/Cloud_robotics/single_task_learning.md).

- Unseen Task Processing Algorithm: Supports lifelong learning with pretrained models to handle unseen tasks effectively. [Access the example](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/tree/main/examples/cityscapes/lifelong_learning_bench/unseen_task_processing-GANwithSelfTaughtLearning) and gain insights from the [background documentation](https://github.com/kubeedge/ianvs/blob/main/docs/proposals/algorithms/lifelong-learning/Unknown_Task_Processing_Algorithm_based_on_Lifelong_Learning_of_Ianvs.md).
